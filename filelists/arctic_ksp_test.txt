/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0196_trimmed.wav|How can you manage all alone, Mr Young.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0373_trimmed.wav|Points of view, new ideas, life.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0215_trimmed.wav|They die out of spite.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0292_trimmed.wav|The Fire-Men wore animal skins around their waists and across their shoulders.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0186_trimmed.wav|I can't go elsewhere, by your own account.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0401_trimmed.wav|The man smiled grimly, and brought a hatchet and a club.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0558_trimmed.wav|And the foundation stone of service, in his case, was obedience.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0071_trimmed.wav|There was no answer from the other side.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0044_trimmed.wav|For a few moments he ate in silence.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0035_trimmed.wav|After all, the picture was only a resemblance.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0020_trimmed.wav|Clubs and balls and cities grew to be only memories.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0424_trimmed.wav|Obviously, it was a disease that could be contracted by contact.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0215_trimmed.wav|It is a good property, and worth more than that.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0545_trimmed.wav|The Italian rancho was a bachelor establishment.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0415_trimmed.wav|There was nothing for us but the wide raw ocean.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0479_trimmed.wav|I tried to read George Moore last night, and was dreadfully bored.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0132_trimmed.wav|There is no need of further detail, now -- for you can understand.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0062_trimmed.wav|The men stared into each other's face.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0142_trimmed.wav|Something vastly more thrilling had come into it now.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0308_trimmed.wav|We never made another migration.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0261_trimmed.wav|And he did hurt my arm.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0408_trimmed.wav|The Eldorado emptied its occupants into the street to see the test.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0019_trimmed.wav|His slim hands gripped the edges of the table.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0393_trimmed.wav|I was still weak from my prolonged immersion.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0422_trimmed.wav|This was when the explosion occurred.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0505_trimmed.wav|We fished sharks on Niihau together.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0500_trimmed.wav|Who the devil gave it to you to be judge and jury.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0503_trimmed.wav|The scents of strange vegetation blew off the tropic land.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0139_trimmed.wav|Together they ate the rabbit.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0377_trimmed.wav|A scarlet loincloth completed his costume.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0523_trimmed.wav|The Russian music player, the Count, was her obedient slave.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0434_trimmed.wav|A half a case of tobacco was worth three pounds.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0261_trimmed.wav|I have been doubly baptized.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0020_trimmed.wav|He made no reply as he waited for Whittemore to continue.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0163_trimmed.wav|Philip made no effort to follow.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0357_trimmed.wav|The Law of Club and Fang
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0532_trimmed.wav|That Longfellow chap most likely had written countless books of poetry.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0273_trimmed.wav|They are big trees and require plenty of room.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0384_trimmed.wav|The farmer works the soil and produces grain.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0218_trimmed.wav|The issue was not in doubt.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0277_trimmed.wav|Two of the Folk were already up.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0388_trimmed.wav|I made no more overtures.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0453_trimmed.wav|Eighteen hundred, he calculated.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0577_trimmed.wav|Once the jews harp began emitting its barbaric rhythms, Michael was helpless.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0030_trimmed.wav|Gregson held a lighted match until it burnt his fingertips.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0405_trimmed.wav|And each year something happened, and I did not go.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0050_trimmed.wav|All this day Gregson remained in the cabin.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0281_trimmed.wav|Just the same I'd sooner be myself than have book indigestion.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0008_trimmed.wav|Burke himself had criticized it because of the smile.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0477_trimmed.wav|You're going in for grab sharing.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0228_trimmed.wav|But it contributed to the smash.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0463_trimmed.wav|Take my advice and accept the vacation.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0282_trimmed.wav|If you mean to insinuate -- Brentwood began hotly.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0144_trimmed.wav|But there was something even more startling than this resemblance.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0512_trimmed.wav|You should have seen them when they heard me spitting Chinook.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0454_trimmed.wav|Eighteen, he added.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0420_trimmed.wav|On occasion, on this traverse, the Cape Verde Islands are raised.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0083_trimmed.wav|In it there was something that was almost tragedy.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0312_trimmed.wav|Dig in; you're sure good, was Daylight's answer.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0147_trimmed.wav|A moment before he was intoxicated by a joy that was almost madness.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0359_trimmed.wav|Earth and gravel seemed to fill the pan.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0501_trimmed.wav|You're joking me, sir, the other managed to articulate.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0182_trimmed.wav|I was in New York when the crash came.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0229_trimmed.wav|I saw it all myself, and it was splendid.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0280_trimmed.wav|Again the girls applauded, and Mrs Hall cried.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0198_trimmed.wav|Sometimes her dreams were filled with visions.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0253_trimmed.wav|The very opposite is true; they are discouraged vagabonds.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0233_trimmed.wav|So she said, the irate skipper dashed on.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0253_trimmed.wav|He it was that lived to found the family of the Patino.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0278_trimmed.wav|It would give me nervous prostration.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0549_trimmed.wav|Do you know that we weigh every pound of coal we burn.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0340_trimmed.wav|These quick little joys of hers were sources of joy to him.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0189_trimmed.wav|The big-eyed, clucking moose-birds were most annoying.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0271_trimmed.wav|It was put together in a casual, helter-skelter sort of way.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0172_trimmed.wav|Gregson had left the outer door slightly ajar.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0213_trimmed.wav|Between him and the beach was the cane-grass fence of the compound.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0286_trimmed.wav|Give them their choice between a fine or an official whipping.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0162_trimmed.wav|He thought he saw a shudder pass through the Factor's shoulders.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0201_trimmed.wav|I also understand that similar branch organizations have made their appearance in Europe.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0468_trimmed.wav|It was introduced by Representative Dick of Ohio.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0293_trimmed.wav|Between him and all domestic animals there must be no hostilities.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0300_trimmed.wav|Does the old boy often go off at half-cock that way.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0168_trimmed.wav|The Indian felt the worship of her warm in his heart.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0319_trimmed.wav|Daylight was tired, profoundly tired.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0158_trimmed.wav|She obeyed, shrinking back with the baby in her arms.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0539_trimmed.wav|You were making them talk shop, Ruth charged him.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0525_trimmed.wav|The Oligarchy wanted violence, and it set its agents provocateurs to work.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0397_trimmed.wav|The hunters were still arguing and roaring like some semi-human amphibious breed.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0366_trimmed.wav|I forgot how easily I had taught myself from the printed page.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0451_trimmed.wav|I noticed blood spouting from Kerfoot's left hand.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0050_trimmed.wav|In spite of their absurdity the words affected Philip curiously.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0438_trimmed.wav|They ran the canoe in and climbed the high earth bank.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0040_trimmed.wav|The thought set his blood tingling.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0005_trimmed.wav|Will we ever forget it.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0360_trimmed.wav|But he no longer cared quite so much for that form of diversion.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0494_trimmed.wav|Never so strange a prophet came up to Jerusalem.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0533_trimmed.wav|His abnormal power of vision made abstractions take on concrete form.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0306_trimmed.wav|Cameron looked at his hands with their long, sinewy fingers.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0159_trimmed.wav|They look as though he had been drumming a piano all his life.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0455_trimmed.wav|His reward should have been peace and repose.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0307_trimmed.wav|We got few vegetables and fruits, and became fish eaters.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0500_trimmed.wav|Then came my boy code.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0060_trimmed.wav|Anyway, no one saw her like that.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0266_trimmed.wav|They handled two men already, both grub-thieves.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0570_trimmed.wav|Behind him lay the thousand-years-long road across all Siberia and Russia.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0326_trimmed.wav|Our Mr Howison will call upon you at your hotel.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0487_trimmed.wav|The river bared its bosom, and snorting steamboats challenged the wilderness.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0001_trimmed.wav|Author of the danger trail, Philip Steels, etc.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0167_trimmed.wav|A little before dawn of the day following, the fire relief came.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0523_trimmed.wav|They could not continue their method of producing surpluses.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0517_trimmed.wav|Eggshell is not good to eat.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0497_trimmed.wav|One great drawback to farming in California is our long dry summer.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0199_trimmed.wav|Dear Sir, Your second victim has fallen on schedule time.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0423_trimmed.wav|Also, at regular intervals, he would mutter.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0544_trimmed.wav|He may anticipate the day of his death.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0335_trimmed.wav|Red-Eye swung back and forth on the branch farther down.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0298_trimmed.wav|This tacit promise of continued acquaintance gave Saxon a little joy-thrill.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0141_trimmed.wav|It seems like a strange pointing of the hand of God.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0519_trimmed.wav|Yea, I will tell thee.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0524_trimmed.wav|So far as flags were concerned, they were beyond all jurisdiction.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0128_trimmed.wav|Philip bent low over Pierre.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0295_trimmed.wav|And twenty men could hold it with spears and arrows.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0483_trimmed.wav|The flower of the artistic and intellectual world were revolutionists.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0332_trimmed.wav|As to how she dressed, he had no ideas at all.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0466_trimmed.wav|Captain West may be a Samurai, but he is also human.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0172_trimmed.wav|On the far corner of the compound fence a hawk brooded.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0348_trimmed.wav|Would you be satisfied with that one hundredth part of me.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0356_trimmed.wav|He loved to play Chinese lottery.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0328_trimmed.wav|The Fire People, like ourselves, lived in caves.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0540_trimmed.wav|Yea, so are all the lesser animals of today clean.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0309_trimmed.wav|White Leghorns, said Mrs Mortimer.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0368_trimmed.wav|Please do not think that I already know it all.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0273_trimmed.wav|Then it was that a strange thing happened.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0183_trimmed.wav|No, I did not fall among thieves.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0085_trimmed.wav|Her eyes smiled truth at him as he came up the bank.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0241_trimmed.wav|The women they carried away with them to the Big Valley.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0234_trimmed.wav|Why, the average review is more nauseating than cod liver oil.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0057_trimmed.wav|They have won popular sentiment through the newspapers.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0290_trimmed.wav|He placed his paw on one, and its movements were accelerated.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0190_trimmed.wav|Idealism led him to philosophic anarchy, and his family threw him off.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0090_trimmed.wav|The singing voice approached rapidly.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0117_trimmed.wav|She added, with genuine sympathy in her face and voice.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0024_trimmed.wav|It was my reports from the north which chiefly induced people to buy.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0331_trimmed.wav|His partners had starved and died on the Stewart.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0478_trimmed.wav|Also, she has forbidden them smoking their pipes in the after-room.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0328_trimmed.wav|Change chairs, Daylight commanded.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0380_trimmed.wav|But in the canyons water was plentiful and also a luxuriant forest growth.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0203_trimmed.wav|A month in Australia would finish me.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0431_trimmed.wav|Wada and Nakata were in a bit of a funk.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0019_trimmed.wav|I followed the line of the proposed railroad, looking for chances.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0369_trimmed.wav|In partnership with Daylight, the pair raided the San Jose Interurban.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0184_trimmed.wav|Don't you see, I'm chewing this thing in two.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0336_trimmed.wav|How old are you, mother.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0573_trimmed.wav|There was no law on the Yukon save what they made for themselves.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0137_trimmed.wav|Then he stepped back with a low cry of pleasure.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0571_trimmed.wav|He had forgotten to build a fire and thaw out.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0074_trimmed.wav|And now, down there, Eileen was waiting for him.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0581_trimmed.wav|It was this proposition that started the big idea in Daughtry's mind.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0101_trimmed.wav|You, you would not keep the truth from me.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0315_trimmed.wav|Saxon waited, for she knew a fresh idea had struck Billy.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0055_trimmed.wav|She was even more beautiful than when I saw her, before.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0188_trimmed.wav|Two gigantic owls were tearing at the carcass.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0035_trimmed.wav|He stopped, and Philip nodded at the horrified question in his eyes.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0202_trimmed.wav|She turned, fearing that Jacques might see what was in her face.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0235_trimmed.wav|His voice was passionately rebellious.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0198_trimmed.wav|I use great trouble advisedly.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0509_trimmed.wav|He had fulfilled his duty and paid properly.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0509_trimmed.wav|Yet, in accordance with Ernest's test of truth, it worked.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0384_trimmed.wav|The skipper's and Nakata's gymnastics served as a translation without words.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0142_trimmed.wav|Such things had occurred before, he told Philip.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0352_trimmed.wav|Now just what do you want to know.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0487_trimmed.wav|After all superfluous flesh is gone what is left is stringy and resistant.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0452_trimmed.wav|They saw each other for the first time in Boston.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0503_trimmed.wav|His beady black eyes saw bargains where other men saw bankruptcy.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0553_trimmed.wav|I am writing these lines in Honolulu, Hawaii.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0197_trimmed.wav|Such a dog the wise driver kills, or turns loose.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0033_trimmed.wav|He unfolded a long typewritten letter, and handed it to Gregson.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0394_trimmed.wav|It's the strap hangers that'll keep us from going under.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0526_trimmed.wav|Nowhere did the raw earth appear.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0425_trimmed.wav|There were orange-green, gold-green, and a copper-green.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0391_trimmed.wav|At sea, Tuesday, March 17, 1908.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0255_trimmed.wav|Then, again, Tudor had such an irritating way about him.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0587_trimmed.wav|He had comparatively no advantages at first.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0070_trimmed.wav|There was no chance to fire without hitting him.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0009_trimmed.wav|He turned sharply, and faced Gregson across the table.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0337_trimmed.wav|Here he got a fresh thrill.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0267_trimmed.wav|The boy threw back his head with pride.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0068_trimmed.wav|Only the chance sound had led him to observe them.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0440_trimmed.wav|Yes, sir, I corrected.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0232_trimmed.wav|I cannot follow you, she said.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0097_trimmed.wav|Besides, that noise makes me deaf.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0270_trimmed.wav|We could throw stones with our feet.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0280_trimmed.wav|I'll be out of my head in fifteen minutes.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0066_trimmed.wav|If I meet her again I shall apologize, said Eileen.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0024_trimmed.wav|It is growing, every day, every hour.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0184_trimmed.wav|Such things in her brain were like so many oaths on her lips.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0327_trimmed.wav|He had been so easy.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0530_trimmed.wav|He had a big chimpanzee that was a winner.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0244_trimmed.wav|He was the soul of devotion to his employers.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0013_trimmed.wav|He was a head shorter than his companion, of almost delicate physique.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0450_trimmed.wav|No man ate of the seal meat or the oil.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0084_trimmed.wav|Your face is red with blood.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0165_trimmed.wav|He pulled, and the log crashed down to break his back.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0032_trimmed.wav|He caught himself with a jerk.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0080_trimmed.wav|Tomorrow it will be strong enough for you to stand upon.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0446_trimmed.wav|Some one had thrust a large sheath-knife into his hand.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0211_trimmed.wav|It drowned all sound that brute agony and death may have made.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0092_trimmed.wav|He went down in midstream, searching the shadows of both shores.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0248_trimmed.wav|I had been sad too long already.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0367_trimmed.wav|Any average young fellow can teach himself in a week.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0140_trimmed.wav|Accept a father's blessing, and with it, this.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0488_trimmed.wav|Their love burned with increasing brightness.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0439_trimmed.wav|The land exchanged its austere robes for the garb of a smiling wanton.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0341_trimmed.wav|I play that choice wide open to win.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0426_trimmed.wav|They do not know the length of time of incubation.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0255_trimmed.wav|You won't die of malnutrition, be sure of that.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0203_trimmed.wav|They were following the shore of a lake.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0105_trimmed.wav|I know that you are in charge there, and Jeanne knows.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0076_trimmed.wav|Before Philip could recover himself Jeanne's startled guards were upon him.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0496_trimmed.wav|I have seen myself that one man contemplated by Pascal's philosophic eye.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0113_trimmed.wav|There was something pathetic in the girl's attitude now.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0043_trimmed.wav|It seemed nearer to him since he had seen and talked with Gregson.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0092_trimmed.wav|I want to die in it.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0148_trimmed.wav|Now these things had been struck dead within him.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0373_trimmed.wav|Unlike Joshua, he stood in no need of divine assistance.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0069_trimmed.wav|Could the incident have anything to do with Jeanne and Pierre.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0317_trimmed.wav|He did not believe in the burning of daylight for such a luxury.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0486_trimmed.wav|For the rest, he was a mere automaton.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0260_trimmed.wav|It's worth eight dollars.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0134_trimmed.wav|He obeyed the pressure of her hand.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0153_trimmed.wav|MacDougall tapped his forehead suspiciously with a stubby forefinger.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0150_trimmed.wav|And he was filled with a strange and foreboding fear.
