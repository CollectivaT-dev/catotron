/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0307_pad.wav|We got few vegetables and fruits, and became fish eaters.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0500_pad.wav|Then came my boy code.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0060_pad.wav|Anyway, no one saw her like that.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0266_pad.wav|They handled two men already, both grub-thieves.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0570_pad.wav|Behind him lay the thousand-years-long road across all Siberia and Russia.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0326_pad.wav|Our Mr Howison will call upon you at your hotel.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0487_pad.wav|The river bared its bosom, and snorting steamboats challenged the wilderness.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0001_pad.wav|Author of the danger trail, Philip Steels, etc.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0167_pad.wav|A little before dawn of the day following, the fire relief came.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0523_pad.wav|They could not continue their method of producing surpluses.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0517_pad.wav|Eggshell is not good to eat.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0497_pad.wav|One great drawback to farming in California is our long dry summer.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0199_pad.wav|Dear Sir, Your second victim has fallen on schedule time.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0423_pad.wav|Also, at regular intervals, he would mutter.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0544_pad.wav|He may anticipate the day of his death.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0335_pad.wav|Red-Eye swung back and forth on the branch farther down.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0298_pad.wav|This tacit promise of continued acquaintance gave Saxon a little joy-thrill.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0141_pad.wav|It seems like a strange pointing of the hand of God.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0519_pad.wav|Yea, I will tell thee.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0524_pad.wav|So far as flags were concerned, they were beyond all jurisdiction.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0128_pad.wav|Philip bent low over Pierre.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0295_pad.wav|And twenty men could hold it with spears and arrows.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0483_pad.wav|The flower of the artistic and intellectual world were revolutionists.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0332_pad.wav|As to how she dressed, he had no ideas at all.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0466_pad.wav|Captain West may be a Samurai, but he is also human.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0172_pad.wav|On the far corner of the compound fence a hawk brooded.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0348_pad.wav|Would you be satisfied with that one hundredth part of me.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0356_pad.wav|He loved to play Chinese lottery.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0328_pad.wav|The Fire People, like ourselves, lived in caves.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0540_pad.wav|Yea, so are all the lesser animals of today clean.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0309_pad.wav|White Leghorns, said Mrs Mortimer.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0368_pad.wav|Please do not think that I already know it all.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0273_pad.wav|Then it was that a strange thing happened.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0183_pad.wav|No, I did not fall among thieves.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0085_pad.wav|Her eyes smiled truth at him as he came up the bank.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0241_pad.wav|The women they carried away with them to the Big Valley.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0234_pad.wav|Why, the average review is more nauseating than cod liver oil.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0057_pad.wav|They have won popular sentiment through the newspapers.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0290_pad.wav|He placed his paw on one, and its movements were accelerated.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0190_pad.wav|Idealism led him to philosophic anarchy, and his family threw him off.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0090_pad.wav|The singing voice approached rapidly.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0117_pad.wav|She added, with genuine sympathy in her face and voice.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0024_pad.wav|It was my reports from the north which chiefly induced people to buy.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0331_pad.wav|His partners had starved and died on the Stewart.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0478_pad.wav|Also, she has forbidden them smoking their pipes in the after-room.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0328_pad.wav|Change chairs, Daylight commanded.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0380_pad.wav|But in the canyons water was plentiful and also a luxuriant forest growth.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0203_pad.wav|A month in Australia would finish me.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0431_pad.wav|Wada and Nakata were in a bit of a funk.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0019_pad.wav|I followed the line of the proposed railroad, looking for chances.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0369_pad.wav|In partnership with Daylight, the pair raided the San Jose Interurban.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0184_pad.wav|Don't you see, I'm chewing this thing in two.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0336_pad.wav|How old are you, mother.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0573_pad.wav|There was no law on the Yukon save what they made for themselves.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0137_pad.wav|Then he stepped back with a low cry of pleasure.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0571_pad.wav|He had forgotten to build a fire and thaw out.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0074_pad.wav|And now, down there, Eileen was waiting for him.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0581_pad.wav|It was this proposition that started the big idea in Daughtry's mind.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0101_pad.wav|You, you would not keep the truth from me.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0315_pad.wav|Saxon waited, for she knew a fresh idea had struck Billy.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0055_pad.wav|She was even more beautiful than when I saw her, before.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0188_pad.wav|Two gigantic owls were tearing at the carcass.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0035_pad.wav|He stopped, and Philip nodded at the horrified question in his eyes.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0202_pad.wav|She turned, fearing that Jacques might see what was in her face.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0235_pad.wav|His voice was passionately rebellious.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0198_pad.wav|I use great trouble advisedly.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0509_pad.wav|He had fulfilled his duty and paid properly.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0509_pad.wav|Yet, in accordance with Ernest's test of truth, it worked.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0384_pad.wav|The skipper's and Nakata's gymnastics served as a translation without words.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0142_pad.wav|Such things had occurred before, he told Philip.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0352_pad.wav|Now just what do you want to know.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0487_pad.wav|After all superfluous flesh is gone what is left is stringy and resistant.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0452_pad.wav|They saw each other for the first time in Boston.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0503_pad.wav|His beady black eyes saw bargains where other men saw bankruptcy.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0553_pad.wav|I am writing these lines in Honolulu, Hawaii.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0197_pad.wav|Such a dog the wise driver kills, or turns loose.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0033_pad.wav|He unfolded a long typewritten letter, and handed it to Gregson.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0394_pad.wav|It's the strap hangers that'll keep us from going under.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0526_pad.wav|Nowhere did the raw earth appear.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0425_pad.wav|There were orange-green, gold-green, and a copper-green.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0391_pad.wav|At sea, Tuesday, March 17, 1908.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0255_pad.wav|Then, again, Tudor had such an irritating way about him.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0587_pad.wav|He had comparatively no advantages at first.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0070_pad.wav|There was no chance to fire without hitting him.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0009_pad.wav|He turned sharply, and faced Gregson across the table.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0337_pad.wav|Here he got a fresh thrill.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0267_pad.wav|The boy threw back his head with pride.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0068_pad.wav|Only the chance sound had led him to observe them.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0440_pad.wav|Yes, sir, I corrected.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0232_pad.wav|I cannot follow you, she said.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0097_pad.wav|Besides, that noise makes me deaf.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0270_pad.wav|We could throw stones with our feet.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0280_pad.wav|I'll be out of my head in fifteen minutes.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0066_pad.wav|If I meet her again I shall apologize, said Eileen.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0024_pad.wav|It is growing, every day, every hour.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0184_pad.wav|Such things in her brain were like so many oaths on her lips.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0327_pad.wav|He had been so easy.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0530_pad.wav|He had a big chimpanzee that was a winner.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0244_pad.wav|He was the soul of devotion to his employers.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0013_pad.wav|He was a head shorter than his companion, of almost delicate physique.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0450_pad.wav|No man ate of the seal meat or the oil.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0084_pad.wav|Your face is red with blood.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0165_pad.wav|He pulled, and the log crashed down to break his back.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0032_pad.wav|He caught himself with a jerk.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0080_pad.wav|Tomorrow it will be strong enough for you to stand upon.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0446_pad.wav|Some one had thrust a large sheath-knife into his hand.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0211_pad.wav|It drowned all sound that brute agony and death may have made.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0092_pad.wav|He went down in midstream, searching the shadows of both shores.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0248_pad.wav|I had been sad too long already.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0367_pad.wav|Any average young fellow can teach himself in a week.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0140_pad.wav|Accept a father's blessing, and with it, this.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0488_pad.wav|Their love burned with increasing brightness.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0439_pad.wav|The land exchanged its austere robes for the garb of a smiling wanton.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0341_pad.wav|I play that choice wide open to win.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0426_pad.wav|They do not know the length of time of incubation.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0255_pad.wav|You won't die of malnutrition, be sure of that.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0203_pad.wav|They were following the shore of a lake.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0105_pad.wav|I know that you are in charge there, and Jeanne knows.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0076_pad.wav|Before Philip could recover himself Jeanne's startled guards were upon him.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0496_pad.wav|I have seen myself that one man contemplated by Pascal's philosophic eye.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0113_pad.wav|There was something pathetic in the girl's attitude now.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0043_pad.wav|It seemed nearer to him since he had seen and talked with Gregson.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0092_pad.wav|I want to die in it.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0148_pad.wav|Now these things had been struck dead within him.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0373_pad.wav|Unlike Joshua, he stood in no need of divine assistance.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0069_pad.wav|Could the incident have anything to do with Jeanne and Pierre.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0317_pad.wav|He did not believe in the burning of daylight for such a luxury.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0486_pad.wav|For the rest, he was a mere automaton.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0260_pad.wav|It's worth eight dollars.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0134_pad.wav|He obeyed the pressure of her hand.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0153_pad.wav|MacDougall tapped his forehead suspiciously with a stubby forefinger.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0150_pad.wav|And he was filled with a strange and foreboding fear.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0492_pad.wav|Burnt out like the crater of a volcano.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0405_pad.wav|It seemed the ordained order of things that dogs should work.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0018_pad.wav|There was a change now.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0366_pad.wav|A wildly exciting time was his during the week preceding Thursday the eighteenth.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0534_pad.wav|But Johannes could, and did.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0240_pad.wav|There are four, all low, McCoy answered.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0096_pad.wav|Perhaps she had already met her fate a little deeper in the forest.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0144_pad.wav|But there was no longer the mother yearning in his heart.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0502_pad.wav|Anything unusual or abnormal was sufficient to send a fellow to Molokai.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0078_pad.wav|Then, and at supper, he tried to fathom her.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0396_pad.wav|The pain from my hurt knee was agonizing.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0465_pad.wav|He'll never do a tap of work the whole Voyage.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0095_pad.wav|He heard a sound which brought him quickly into consciousness of day.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0334_pad.wav|Oh, it's just a novel, a love story.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0417_pad.wav|The next thing to watch out for is bed sores.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0467_pad.wav|And so early in the voyage, too.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0117_pad.wav|That's Thorpe's, said the young engineer.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0563_pad.wav|Mrs McFee's jaws brought together with a snap.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0411_pad.wav|He gave no reason, but his motive was obvious enough.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0016_pad.wav|There's Fort Churchill, a rifle-shot beyond the ridge, asleep.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0067_pad.wav|Surely I will excuse you, she cried.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0181_pad.wav|And you preferred a cannibal isle and a cartridge belt.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0472_pad.wav|Ernest saw in the affair the most sinister import.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0034_pad.wav|Men of Selden's stamp don't stop at women and children.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0376_pad.wav|Thought I, and a worthy fool he proved.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0514_pad.wav|We are consumed in our own flesh-pots.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0291_pad.wav|The awe of man rushed over him again.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0093_pad.wav|For a full minute he crouched and listened.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0518_pad.wav|But there was also talk of witchcraft in the village.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0282_pad.wav|Some of the smaller veins had doubtless been ruptured.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0435_pad.wav|What do you mean by this outrageous conduct.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0473_pad.wav|The night was calm and snowy.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0012_pad.wav|Gregson shoved back his chair and rose to his feet.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0260_pad.wav|Nobody knew his history, they of the Junta least of all.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0530_pad.wav|Ask him, I laughed, then turned to Pasquini.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0233_pad.wav|I never allow what can't be changed to annoy me.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0461_pad.wav|By virtue of that power we shall remain in power.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0125_pad.wav|It was the third or fourth time that Philip had heard MacDougall swear.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0195_pad.wav|Nobody knows how the natives got them.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0164_pad.wav|He came first a year ago, and revealed himself to Jeanne.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0512_pad.wav|No, it is a palace, wherein there are many servants.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0015_pad.wav|It's the aurora borealis.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0342_pad.wav|Each improvement makes the value of everything else pump up.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0141_pad.wav|It was beating and waiting in the ambush of those black pits.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0547_pad.wav|Men like Joe Goose dated existence from drunk to drunk.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0345_pad.wav|Daylight made no answer, and the door closed behind him.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0537_pad.wav|But she had become an automaton.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0094_pad.wav|And yet if she came he had no words to say.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0393_pad.wav|Already he had begun borrowing from the banks.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0441_pad.wav|And there was Ethel Baird, whom also you must remember.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0435_pad.wav|Well, did they eat.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0590_pad.wav|In a way he is my protege.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0265_pad.wav|The discovery seemed to have been made on the spur of the moment.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0326_pad.wav|Cherokee identified himself with his instinct.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0029_pad.wav|All operations have been carried on from Montreal and Toronto.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0098_pad.wav|Philip looked back from the crest and saw Jeanne leaning over the canoe.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0093_pad.wav|Darkness hid him from Jeanne.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0402_pad.wav|An altruistic act is an act performed for the welfare of others.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0437_pad.wav|Nowhere in the North is the soil so prolific.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0230_pad.wav|Now run along, and tell them to hurry.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0136_pad.wav|Swiftly his eyes measured the situation.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0290_pad.wav|One by one the boys were captured.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0073_pad.wav|The promoter's eyes were heavy, with little puffy bags under them.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0479_pad.wav|Violation of this law was made a high misdemeanor and punished accordingly.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0153_pad.wav|He was a pariah; a wanderer without a friend or a home.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0300_pad.wav|From my earliest recollection my sleep was a period of terror.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0406_pad.wav|How in hell did he know it was you in the dark.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0208_pad.wav|You read the quotations in today's paper.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0031_pad.wav|Gregson had seated himself under the lamp and was sharpening a pencil.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0409_pad.wav|The dirk mentioned by Wolf Larsen rested in its sheath on my hip.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0321_pad.wav|The log on which Lop-Ear was lying got adrift.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0046_pad.wav|Philip produced a couple of cigars and took a chair opposite him.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0078_pad.wav|There was pride and strength, the ring of triumph in his voice.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0254_pad.wav|Straight out they swam, their heads growing smaller and smaller.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0210_pad.wav|Whatever he guessed he locked away in the taboo room of Naomi.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0319_pad.wav|And the Edinburgh Evening News says, with editorial gloom.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0365_pad.wav|These rumors may even originate with us.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0522_pad.wav|Nor would it thaw out his hands and feet.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0086_pad.wav|He can care for himself.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0264_pad.wav|But this time it was Saxon who rebelled.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0414_pad.wav|It was impossible to hoist sail and claw off that shore.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0381_pad.wav|And how would we ever find ourselves.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0028_pad.wav|Lord Fitzhugh is the key to the whole situation.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0208_pad.wav|Youth had come back to her, freed from the yoke of oppression.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0386_pad.wav|My idea was that he would have more influence over the natives.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0332_pad.wav|Unconsciously, our yells and exclamations yielded to this rhythm.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0560_pad.wav|His mouth opened; words shaped vainly on his lips.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0404_pad.wav|Perrault found one with head buried in the grub box.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0351_pad.wav|It was more like sugar.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0360_pad.wav|This state of mind comes of an undue prominence of the ego.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0219_pad.wav|At first he puzzled over something untoward he was sure had happened.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0302_pad.wav|It is very plausible to such people, a most convincing hypothesis.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0480_pad.wav|Without discussion, it was the agents provocateurs who caused the Peasant Revolt.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0169_pad.wav|Suddenly Jeanne stopped for an instant.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0088_pad.wav|He made sure that the magazine was loaded, and resumed his paddling.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0480_pad.wav|Tom Spink has a harpoon.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0374_pad.wav|To say the least, Captain Cook was a rather thorough going empiricist.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0002_pad.wav|Not at this particular case, Tom, apologized Whittemore.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0364_pad.wav|We have plenty of capital ourselves, and yet we want more.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0037_pad.wav|I was the only one who remained sitting.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0447_pad.wav|Ah, it is growing dark and darker.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0301_pad.wav|A flying arrow passed between us.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0399_pad.wav|You were looking squeamish this afternoon, he began.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0221_pad.wav|I don't know why you're here at all.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0401_pad.wav|I learned it myself in English ships.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0053_pad.wav|That is why I am, am rattled, he laughed.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0052_pad.wav|The flush was gone from her face.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0315_pad.wav|And this was their sole conversation throughout the meal.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0568_pad.wav|He was just bursting with joy, joy over what.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0325_pad.wav|It was a gigantic inadequacy.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0017_pad.wav|Everything was working smoothly, better than I had expected.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0123_pad.wav|She had died from cold and starvation.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0343_pad.wav|You mean for this State, General, Alberta.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0246_pad.wav|You have heard always how he was the lover of the Princess Naomi.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0214_pad.wav|Besides, he was paid one case of tobacco per head.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0091_pad.wav|For a full half minute Jeanne looked at him without speaking.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0251_pad.wav|They must have been swept away by the chaotic currents.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0161_pad.wav|Take away their foreman and they wouldn't be worth their grub.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0240_pad.wav|Wash your hands of me.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0423_pad.wav|McVeigh when he returns from a trip to Honolulu.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0489_pad.wav|They were artists, not biologists.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0419_pad.wav|The Portuguese boy passed the Hawaiian.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0297_pad.wav|There's a big English general right now whose name is Roberts.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0185_pad.wav|Your being wrecked here has been a godsend to me.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0318_pad.wav|Again he had done the big thing.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0088_pad.wav|Until I die, he exclaimed.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0381_pad.wav|My name's Ferguson.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0459_pad.wav|They are not biologists nor sociologists.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0413_pad.wav|He may desire to escape pain, or to enjoy pleasure.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0055_pad.wav|Philip stood undecided, his ears strained to catch the slightest sound.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0054_pad.wav|There was nothing on the rock.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0223_pad.wav|They likewise are disinclined to being eaten.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0564_pad.wav|Then it is as I said, Womble announced with finality.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0524_pad.wav|At once would be instituted a dozen cooperative commonwealth states.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0112_pad.wav|He was wounded in the arm.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0283_pad.wav|But we were without this momentum.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0270_pad.wav|And after the bath a shave would not be bad.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0441_pad.wav|Violent life and athletic sports had never appealed to me.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0404_pad.wav|Yes, and no, sir, was the slow reply.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0076_pad.wav|The gray eyes faltered; the flush deepened.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0046_pad.wav|The girl faced him, her eyes shining with sudden fear.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0520_pad.wav|He was fond of quoting a fragment from a certain poem.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0288_pad.wav|We would not spend another such night.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0033_pad.wav|How does your wager look now.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0056_pad.wav|I'll give a thousand if you produce her, retorted Gregson.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0313_pad.wav|Broken-Tooth yelled with fright and pain.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0445_pad.wav|Mops, sir, eagerly answered the sailor at the wheel.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0442_pad.wav|You live on an income which your father earned.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0416_pad.wav|I arose obediently and went down the beach.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0391_pad.wav|But he reconciled himself to it by an act of faith.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0082_pad.wav|His face was streaming with blood.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0075_pad.wav|There has been a change, she interrupted him.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0037_pad.wav|Philip knew that she was not an Indian.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0327_pad.wav|They were less stooped than we, less springy in their movements.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0224_pad.wav|But to culture the Revolution thus far had exhausted the Junta.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0488_pad.wav|Beyond refusing to sell us food, they left us to ourselves.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0165_pad.wav|They are to attack your camp tomorrow night.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0305_pad.wav|They had no fixed values, to be altered by adjectives and adverbs.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0510_pad.wav|Much more Ernest told them of themselves and of his disillusionment.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0403_pad.wav|Knowing him, I review the old Scandinavian myths with clearer understanding.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0412_pad.wav|There is another virtue in these bulkheads.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0362_pad.wav|We threaten to be of the one mind before the voyage is completed.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0025_pad.wav|I was about to do this when cooler judgment prevailed.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0295_pad.wav|All right, Sir, replied Jock with great regret.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0416_pad.wav|The added weight had a velocity of fifteen miles per hour.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0069_pad.wav|It was his intention to return to Eileen and her father.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0089_pad.wav|Her beautiful hair was done up in shining coils.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0508_pad.wav|In his anxiety and solicitude and love they did not count.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0166_pad.wav|Two days ago Jeanne learned where her father's men were hiding.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0003_pad.wav|For the twentieth time that evening the two men shook hands.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0448_pad.wav|Sandel would never become a world champion.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0256_pad.wav|Outwardly, he maintained a calm and smiling aspect.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0150_pad.wav|Goodbye, Pierre, he shouted.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0556_pad.wav|Why, he's bought forty pounds of goods from you already.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0028_pad.wav|Robbery, bribery, fraud, 
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0399_pad.wav|And here's another idea.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0338_pad.wav|The fighting had now become intermittent.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0146_pad.wav|Of course, that is uninteresting, she continued.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0408_pad.wav|You have all the advantage.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0507_pad.wav|Did I possess too much vitality.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0130_pad.wav|She saw the answer in his face.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0247_pad.wav|They ought to pass here some time today.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0178_pad.wav|Also, I want information.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0190_pad.wav|Next to them the Canada jays were most persistent.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0236_pad.wav|Oolong was two hundred and fifty miles from the nearest land.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0510_pad.wav|He knew what taboos he was violating.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0343_pad.wav|But how are you going to do it.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0229_pad.wav|The last one I knew was an overseer.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0151_pad.wav|And MacDougall was beyond the trail, with three weeks to spare.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0358_pad.wav|They continued valiantly to lie, but the truth continued to outrun them.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0138_pad.wav|In the picture he saw each moment a greater resemblance to Jeanne.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0367_pad.wav|There is not an iota of truth in it, certainly not.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0445_pad.wav|The creative joy, I murmured.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0176_pad.wav|I'll see to poor Hughie.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0227_pad.wav|Shorty turned to their employers.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0066_pad.wav|He saw Jeanne falter for a moment.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0106_pad.wav|The emotion which she had suppressed burst forth now in a choking sob.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0322_pad.wav|This is a common experience with all of us.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0250_pad.wav|By this time Charley was as enraged as the Greek.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0059_pad.wav|In moments of mental energy Philip was restless.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0200_pad.wav|He leapt again, and the club caught him once more.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0375_pad.wav|Man could not conquer them.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0023_pad.wav|MacDougall, my engineer, believes it.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0392_pad.wav|Yes, sir, he answered, with cheerful alacrity.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0276_pad.wav|Oolong Atoll was one hundred and forty miles in circumference.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0204_pad.wav|Down through the perfume weighted air fluttered the snowy fluffs of the cottonwoods.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0412_pad.wav|Ah, it was sweet in my ears.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0533_pad.wav|Dunham, can your boy go along with Jesse.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0263_pad.wav|Joan looked triumphantly at Sheldon, who bowed.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0056_pad.wav|Pearce's little eyes were fixed on him shrewdly.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0414_pad.wav|Now our figuring was all right.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0484_pad.wav|This the Iron Heel foresaw and laid its schemes accordingly.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0110_pad.wav|Such men believe, when they come together.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0320_pad.wav|The regret in his voice was provocative of a second burst of laughter.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0341_pad.wav|Why, doggone you all, shake again.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0557_pad.wav|The last refugee had passed.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0079_pad.wav|The truth of it set Jeanne quivering.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0160_pad.wav|It was over when he made his way through the ring of spectators.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0002_pad.wav|You got out by fighting, and I through a pretty girl.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0442_pad.wav|He had become a man very early in life.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0042_pad.wav|How could he explain his possession of the sketch.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0121_pad.wav|I want my men to work by themselves.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0016_pad.wav|He chuckled as he pulled out his pipe and began filling it.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0113_pad.wav|I suppose you picked that lingo up among the Indians.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0125_pad.wav|He was determined now to maintain a more certain hold upon himself.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0320_pad.wav|With my strength I slammed it full into Red-Eye's face.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0316_pad.wav|Though the aurora still flamed, another day had begun.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0324_pad.wav|It was not Red-Eye's way to forego revenge so easily.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0490_pad.wav|What an excited whispering and conferring took place.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0254_pad.wav|At the same time spears and arrows began to fall among the invaders.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0239_pad.wav|He cried in such genuine dismay that she broke into hearty laughter.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0529_pad.wav|As I say, he had tapped the message very rapidly.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0389_pad.wav|Among my minor afflictions, I may mention a new and mysterious one.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0516_pad.wav|Also, there was awe in their faces.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0448_pad.wav|I was Hump, cabin boy on the schooner Ghost.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0370_pad.wav|He saw all men in the business game doing this.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0471_pad.wav|I saw Mr Pike nod his head grimly and sarcastically.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0095_pad.wav|A big canvas tent was the first thing to come within his vision.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0130_pad.wav|She was his now, forever.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0057_pad.wav|I have no idea, replied Philip.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0085_pad.wav|A trickle of fresh blood ran over his face.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0073_pad.wav|With these arguments he convinced himself that he should go on alone.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0314_pad.wav|He had been born with this endowment.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0528_pad.wav|Captain Doane's orders were swiftly obeyed.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0250_pad.wav|He had observed the business life of Hawaii and developed a vaulting ambition.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0469_pad.wav|Very few people knew of the existence of this law.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0021_pad.wav|Philip dropped back into his chair.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0297_pad.wav|Why should a fellow throw up the sponge after the first round.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0099_pad.wav|Fifty yards ahead of her were the first of the rocks.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0492_pad.wav|Thus he turned the tenets and jargon of psychology back on me.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0221_pad.wav|It's a Yankee, Joan cried.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0460_pad.wav|I had forgotten their existence.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0578_pad.wav|But we'll just postpone this.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0176_pad.wav|For the first time in his life he was yearning for a scrap.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0039_pad.wav|The ship should be in within a week or ten days.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0324_pad.wav|Not till the twentieth of May did the river break.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0534_pad.wav|I'll tell you, the librarian said with a brightening face.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0023_pad.wav|A combination of Canadian capital quickly organized and petitioned for the same privileges.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0091_pad.wav|His blood grew hot with rage at the thought.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0160_pad.wav|You want to go over and see his gang throw dirt.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0379_pad.wav|Christmas is an easy problem compared with a Polynesian giving-feast.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0532_pad.wav|May drought destroy your crops.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0143_pad.wav|Ah, I had forgotten, he exclaimed.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0433_pad.wav|We are cooking on the coal stove and on the oil burners.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0257_pad.wav|They are coming ashore, whoever they are.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0354_pad.wav|Fresh meat they failed to obtain.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0347_pad.wav|They are greatly delighted with anything that is bright or giveth a sound.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0109_pad.wav|Philip ate lightly of the food which Pierre had ready for him.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0434_pad.wav|The steward has just tendered me a respectful bit of advice.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0369_pad.wav|You see, we were teaching ourselves.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0191_pad.wav|He also contended that better confidence was established by carrying no weapons.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0148_pad.wav|The Indian even poked his stick into the thick ground spruce.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0398_pad.wav|In the car were Unwin and Harrison, while Jones sat with the chauffeur.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0546_pad.wav|I lost my balance and pitched head foremost into the ooze.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0048_pad.wav|He looked at the handkerchief more, closely.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0498_pad.wav|The lines were now very taut.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0038_pad.wav|In her haste to get away she had forgotten these things.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0475_pad.wav|Not a wheel moved in his empire.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0077_pad.wav|It is the nearest refuge.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0278_pad.wav|Now animals do not like mockery.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0472_pad.wav|He is too keenly intelligent, too sharply sensitive, successfully to endure.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0096_pad.wav|Within himself he called it no longer his own.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0108_pad.wav|He waded into the edge of the water and began scrubbing himself.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0079_pad.wav|It was a large canoe.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0242_pad.wav|I saw it when she rolled.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0274_pad.wav|From the source of light a harsh voice said.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0383_pad.wav|To his surprise, her answer was flat and uncompromising.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0232_pad.wav|It was a superb picture.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0484_pad.wav|No-sir-ee.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0045_pad.wav|Philip did not pursue the subject.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0453_pad.wav|Isaac Ford, the austere soldier of the Lord, the old hypocrite.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0337_pad.wav|Encouraged by my conduct, Big-Face became a sudden ally.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0237_pad.wav|They just lay off in the bush and plugged away.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0197_pad.wav|The planters are already considering the matter.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0409_pad.wav|He could feel a new stir in the land.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0127_pad.wav|He destroyed everything that had belonged to the woman.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0486_pad.wav|But why continue the tirade, for tirade it was.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0274_pad.wav|And Raoul listened again to the tale of the house.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0025_pad.wav|Now, you understand.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0220_pad.wav|Harry Bancroft, Dave lied.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0491_pad.wav|Jacob Brinker, who was his roadmate, brought the news.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0169_pad.wav|He drew in a deep breath as he looked at them.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0269_pad.wav|Why not like any railroad station or ferry depot.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0193_pad.wav|So was Packard's finish suicide.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0506_pad.wav|It would help to tide me along until I got steady employment.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0217_pad.wav|Such is my passage engaged on the steamer.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0446_pad.wav|He deluged me, overwhelmed me with argument.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0256_pad.wav|See the length of the body and that elongated neck.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0325_pad.wav|Whiz-zip-bang. Lop-Ear screamed with sudden anguish.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0330_pad.wav|Red-Eye never committed a more outrageous deed.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0475_pad.wav|His outstretched arm dropped to his side, and he paused.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0139_pad.wav|He told himself that as he washed himself and groomed his disheveled clothes.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0398_pad.wav|I have been robbed, sir, I amended.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0011_pad.wav|If I ever needed a fighter in my life I need one now.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0428_pad.wav|The history of our westward-faring race is written in it.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0458_pad.wav|The stout wood was crushed like an eggshell.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0495_pad.wav|He bore no grudges and had few enemies.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0356_pad.wav|You don't catch me at any such foolishness.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0072_pad.wav|Then he hastened on, as Pierre had guided him.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0100_pad.wav|There was one chance, and only one, of saving Jeanne.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0361_pad.wav|But he did not broach it, preferring to mature it carefully.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0034_pad.wav|He confessed that the sketch had startled him.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0313_pad.wav|The apron string loomed near and he shied like an unbroken colt.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0054_pad.wav|He understood the meaning of the look.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0162_pad.wav|That's the sub-foreman, explained Thorpe.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0417_pad.wav|It is also an insidious, deceitful sun.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0497_pad.wav|King took every advantage he knew.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0451_pad.wav|You used to joyride like the very devil.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0537_pad.wav|He was an enthusiast and a desert dweller.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0100_pad.wav|You must sleep, he urged.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0329_pad.wav|Ah, indeed.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0272_pad.wav|These were merely stout sticks an inch or so in diameter.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0238_pad.wav|It happened to him at the Gallina Society in Oakland one afternoon.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0575_pad.wav|There weren't any missions, and he was the man to know.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0421_pad.wav|She is essentially the life-giving, life-conserving female of the species.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0527_pad.wav|The lush vegetation of that sheltered spot make a natural shield.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0550_pad.wav|This also became part of the daily schedule.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0535_pad.wav|He read his fragments aloud.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0516_pad.wav|Zilla relaxed her sour mouth long enough to sigh her satisfaction.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0179_pad.wav|Let them go out and eat with my boys.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0115_pad.wav|For two hours not a word passed between them.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0200_pad.wav|We leave the eventuality to time and law.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0385_pad.wav|Last night he showed all the symptoms of coming down with pneumonia.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0053_pad.wav|Suddenly his fingers closed tightly over the handkerchief.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0051_pad.wav|The lace was of a delicate ivory color, faintly tinted with yellow.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0285_pad.wav|But what they want with your toothbrush is more than I can imagine.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0592_pad.wav|It's only his indigestion I find fault with.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0400_pad.wav|Manuel had one besetting sin.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0081_pad.wav|What if she did not come to the rock.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0067_pad.wav|Below him the shadow was broken into a pool of rippling starlight.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0155_pad.wav|Won't you draw up, gentlemen.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0382_pad.wav|I defy any man to get a Solomon Island sore in California.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0305_pad.wav|It was our river emerging like ourselves from the great swamp.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0493_pad.wav|You yellow giant thing of the frost.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0579_pad.wav|There was the Emma Louisa.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0517_pad.wav|Out of abstractions Ernest had conjured a vision and made them see it.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0118_pad.wav|Pierre obeys me when we are together.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0410_pad.wav|So we have to fit the boat throughout with oil lamps as well.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0275_pad.wav|But I did not enjoy it long.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0424_pad.wav|It is a very tenable hypothesis, and will bear looking into.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0080_pad.wav|What if Jeanne failed him.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0107_pad.wav|If you only could know how I thank you.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0355_pad.wav|There was proper division of labor in the work they individually performed.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0365_pad.wav|My age, in years, is twenty two.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0511_pad.wav|Do you value your hide.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0065_pad.wav|They closed now until his fingers were like cords of steel.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0068_pad.wav|In a flash Philip followed its direction.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0580_pad.wav|This is my fifth voyage.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0005_pad.wav|His slim fingers closed like steel about Philip's.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0312_pad.wav|It lived in perpetual apprehension of that quarter of the compass.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0004_pad.wav|When I can't see beauty in woman I want to die.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0370_pad.wav|And now behold the perversity of things.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0468_pad.wav|In the matter of curry she is a sheer genius.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0249_pad.wav|All eyes, however, were staring at him in certitude of expectancy.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0205_pad.wav|You were destroying my life.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0471_pad.wav|Also a fellow Senator, Chauncey Depew, said.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0333_pad.wav|It does, was her audacious answer.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0194_pad.wav|He drank of the water cautiously.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0090_pad.wav|The Churchill narrowed and its current became swifter as they progressed.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0196_pad.wav|He began to follow the footprints of the dog.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0155_pad.wav|His freshly caught furs he flung to the floor.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0226_pad.wav|Your face was the personification of duplicity.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0008_pad.wav|Gad, your letter came just in time.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0569_pad.wav|At Lake Linderman I had one canoe, very good Peterborough canoe.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0552_pad.wav|Yet he dreams he is immortal, I argue feebly.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0194_pad.wav|Joan cried, with shining eyes.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0349_pad.wav|It was simple, in its way, and no virtue of his.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0284_pad.wav|There was one difficulty, however.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0012_pad.wav|Something that Whittemore had not yet said thrilled him.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0548_pad.wav|Also, churches and preachers I had never known.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0097_pad.wav|Then you can arrange yourself comfortably among these robes in the bow.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0041_pad.wav|Meanwhile I'll go out to breathe a spell.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0287_pad.wav|Or have they already devised one.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0258_pad.wav|Soaked in seawater they offset the heat rays.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0351_pad.wav|Matthewson, who's this bookkeeper, Rogers.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0515_pad.wav|But already he had composed himself.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0390_pad.wav|The voyage was our idea of a good time.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0306_pad.wav|He was pressing beyond the limits of his vocabulary.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0007_pad.wav|Hear the Indian dogs wailing down at Churchill.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0407_pad.wav|Of course much grumbling went on, and little outbursts were continually occurring.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0105_pad.wav|Only, it is so wonderful, so almost impossible to believe.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0227_pad.wav|It was the same way with our revolvers and rifles.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0220_pad.wav|A dead man is of no use on a plantation.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0470_pad.wav|He spat it out like so much venom.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0185_pad.wav|The questions may have come vaguely in his mind.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0583_pad.wav|Enjoy it he did, but principally for Steward's sake.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0129_pad.wav|Her face was against his breast.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0263_pad.wav|Only once did I confide the strangeness of it all to another.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0504_pad.wav|The life there was healthful and athletic, but too juvenile.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0378_pad.wav|That's why its boundaries are all gouged and jagged.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0156_pad.wav|For that reason Le Beau had chosen him to fight the big fight.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0195_pad.wav|But a strange thing happened.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0120_pad.wav|There's the hitch, replied Thorpe, rolling a cigarette.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0584_pad.wav|I have long noted your thirst unquenchable.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0047_pad.wav|Suppose you saw me at work through the window.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0103_pad.wav|He lifted his eyes, and a strange cry burst from his lips.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0061_pad.wav|Something about it seemed to fascinate him, to challenge his presence.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0554_pad.wav|Jack London, Waikiki Beach, Honolulu, Oahu.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0371_pad.wav|It issued a rate of forty two dollars a car on charcoal.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0225_pad.wav|I was brought up the way most girls in Hawaii are brought up.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0074_pad.wav|Yet, behind them there was another and more powerful motive.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0135_pad.wav|In it was the joy of life.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0279_pad.wav|She said with chattering teeth.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0536_pad.wav|He would destroy all things that are fixed.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0464_pad.wav|Between the rush of the cascades, streaks of rust showed everywhere.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0350_pad.wav|Is that Pat Hanrahan's mug looking hungry and willing.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0521_pad.wav|Without them he could not run his empire.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0249_pad.wav|I know they are my oysters.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0494_pad.wav|O'Brien took off his coat and bared his right arm.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0222_pad.wav|What part of the United States is your home.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0210_pad.wav|Its diameter was not more than two hundred yards.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0428_pad.wav|It was not exactly a deportation.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0567_pad.wav|Now Irvine was a man of impulse, a poet.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0499_pad.wav|I said, and dismissed the matter as not worth thinking about.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0183_pad.wav|And the air was growing chilly.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0352_pad.wav|I'm sure going along with you all, Elijah.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0234_pad.wav|And watch out for wet feet, was his parting advice.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0520_pad.wav|Hans hurled himself upon the prostrate man, striking madly with his fists.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0009_pad.wav|I'd say there was going to be a glorious scrap.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0222_pad.wav|He was the leader, and Tudor was his lieutenant.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0433_pad.wav|To her the bridge was tambo, which is the native for taboo.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0395_pad.wav|As for himself, weren't the street railway earnings increasing steadily.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0036_pad.wav|She turned in at the hotel.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0377_pad.wav|This sound did not disturb the hush and awe of the place.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0207_pad.wav|I'm as good as a man, she urged.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0272_pad.wav|You can take a vacation on pay.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0561_pad.wav|Bill lingered, contemplating his work with artistic appreciation.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0508_pad.wav|Soon shall it be thrust back from off prostrate humanity.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0481_pad.wav|The task we set ourselves was threefold.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0335_pad.wav|Whoever lived on the ranch did that.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0287_pad.wav|Keep an eye on him.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0469_pad.wav|The eastern heavens were equally spectacular.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0586_pad.wav|We don't see ourselves as foolish.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0216_pad.wav|The other felt a sudden wave of irritation rush through him.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0275_pad.wav|There are no kiddies and half grown youths among them.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0378_pad.wav|I like to speculate upon the glorious future of man.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0031_pad.wav|They were three hundred yards apart.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0420_pad.wav|When I came to I was waving my hat and murmuring ecstatically.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0013_pad.wav|Lakes and rivers, hundreds of them, thousands of them.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0439_pad.wav|At sea, Wednesday, March 18, 1908.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0077_pad.wav|It is the fire, partly, she said.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0464_pad.wav|I could not agree with Ernest.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0482_pad.wav|Many other similar disconcerting omissions will be noticed in the Manuscript.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0585_pad.wav|Wonder if he's a lion dog, Charles suggested.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0042_pad.wav|Ten minutes had not elapsed since he had dropped the handkerchief.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0450_pad.wav|To my dearest and always appreciated friend, I submit myself.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0318_pad.wav|Production is doubling and quadrupling upon itself.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0303_pad.wav|But they make the mistake of ignoring their own duality.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0461_pad.wav|Ah, we were very close together in that moment.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0380_pad.wav|He had peeled off his shirt and was wildly waving it.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0418_pad.wav|At that moment I got the impression that she was willowy.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0230_pad.wav|Do you know any good land around here.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0212_pad.wav|Fresh cases, still able to walk, they clustered about the spokesman.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0482_pad.wav|And their chief virtue lies in that they will never wear out.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0394_pad.wav|The boy hesitated, then mastered his temper.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0485_pad.wav|Each insult added to the value of the claim.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0038_pad.wav|We'll have to watch our chances.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0331_pad.wav|Poor little Crooked-Leg was terribly scared.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0262_pad.wav|They wouldn't be sweeping a big vessel like the Martha.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0182_pad.wav|This time he did not yap for mercy.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0245_pad.wav|Out of his eighteen hundred, he laid aside sixteen hundred each year.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0462_pad.wav|But she swung obediently on her heel into the wind.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0223_pad.wav|My, I'm almost homesick for it already.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0087_pad.wav|They will search for us between their camp and Churchill.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0323_pad.wav|Crickets began to chirp, and more geese and ducks flew overhead.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0128_pad.wav|This one hope was destroyed as quickly as it was born.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0152_pad.wav|OW, a wild dog, he growled.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0010_pad.wav|He turned the map to Gregson, pointing with his finger.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0048_pad.wav|He looked like one who had passed through an uncomfortable hour or two.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0083_pad.wav|A shadow was creeping over Pierre's eyes.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0535_pad.wav|A new preacher and a new doctrine come to Jerusalem.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0536_pad.wav|Typhoid -- did I tell you.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0115_pad.wav|He had no excuse for the feelings which were aroused in him.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0187_pad.wav|Her achievements with cocoanuts were a revelation.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0513_pad.wav|He plodded on for half an hour, when the hallucination arose again.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0239_pad.wav|And there was a dog that barked.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0375_pad.wav|The butchers and meat cutters refused to handle meat destined for unfair restaurants.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0101_pad.wav|You're a devil for fighting, and will surely win.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0334_pad.wav|He'll knock you off a few sticks in no time.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0244_pad.wav|You are positively soulless, he said savagely.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0022_pad.wav|If I was out of the game it would be easily made.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0175_pad.wav|Down there the earth was already swelling with life.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0021_pad.wav|It fairly clubbed me into recognizing it.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0539_pad.wav|I should like to engage just for one whole life in that.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0191_pad.wav|For a time the exciting thrill of his adventure was gone.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0304_pad.wav|I graduated last of my class.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0167_pad.wav|I was near the cabin, and saw you.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0086_pad.wav|Death had come with terrible suddenness.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0459_pad.wav|There's too much of the schoolboy in me.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0355_pad.wav|A burst of laughter was his reward.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0164_pad.wav|They laughed like two happy children.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0431_pad.wav|Too much, he told me, with ominous rolling head.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0425_pad.wav|Otherwise no restriction is put upon their seafaring.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0354_pad.wav|It's that much junk.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0188_pad.wav|He glanced down at her helplessly, and moistened his lips.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0311_pad.wav|The 29th very foggy.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0045_pad.wav|He moved away as quietly as he had come.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0340_pad.wav|It was like the beating of hoofs.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0131_pad.wav|Thorpe and his men were to destroy this camp, and kill you.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0406_pad.wav|And that was the last of Francois and Perrault.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0286_pad.wav|The time was considered auspicious.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0363_pad.wav|She was built primarily to sail.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0396_pad.wav|A rising tide of fat had submerged them.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0506_pad.wav|The Claudine was leaving next morning for Honolulu.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0157_pad.wav|He had worshiped her, as Dante might have worshiped Beatrice.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0112_pad.wav|Jeanne and Pierre both gazed toward the great rock.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0511_pad.wav|There is more behind this than a mere university ideal.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0127_pad.wav|It was a temptation, but he resisted it.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0456_pad.wav|But it won't continue, she said with easy confidence.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0264_pad.wav|And I hope you've got plenty of chain out, Captain Young.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0362_pad.wav|Nope, not the slightest idea.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0267_pad.wav|Eli Harding asked, as Shunk started to follow.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0466_pad.wav|It is dog eat dog, and you ate them up.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0447_pad.wav|O'Brien emitted a shriek that sank swiftly to a gurgling sob.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0154_pad.wav|That is the strange part of it.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0099_pad.wav|A maddening joy pounded in his brain.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0397_pad.wav|Call me that again, he murmured ecstatically.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0382_pad.wav|Daylight found himself charmed and made curious by the little man.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0010_pad.wav|I'm playing a single hand in what looks like a losing game.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0317_pad.wav|He was a wise hyena.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0140_pad.wav|They edged nearer, and stood shoulder to shoulder facing their world.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0064_pad.wav|The fourth and fifth days passed without any developments.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0052_pad.wav|It was a curious coincidence.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0170_pad.wav|There was none of the joy of meeting in his face.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0476_pad.wav|At this moment I felt a stir at my shoulder.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0565_pad.wav|With them were Indians, also three other men.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0192_pad.wav|Outsiders are allowed five minute speeches, the sick man urged.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0413_pad.wav|But I am at the end of my resources.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0124_pad.wav|Two weeks passed, and in that time Thorpe left camp three times.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0528_pad.wav|Men who endure it, call it living death.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0421_pad.wav|By golly, the boy wins.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0402_pad.wav|Curly rushed her antagonist, who struck again and leaped aside.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0156_pad.wav|A strange fire burned in his eyes when Thorpe turned.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0206_pad.wav|He says he bought him of Jacques Le Beau.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0063_pad.wav|He boiled himself some coffee and sat down to wait.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0202_pad.wav|Society is shaken to its foundations.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0385_pad.wav|That's what Carnegie did.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0478_pad.wav|The Oligarchy will encourage such ambition and the consequent competition.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0432_pad.wav|The boy at the wheel lost his head.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0108_pad.wav|It was a miracle, and I owe you my life.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0440_pad.wav|There were stir and bustle, new faces, and fresh facts.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0224_pad.wav|She nodded, and her eyes grew soft and moist.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0006_pad.wav|God bless 'em, I hope I'll go on seeing them forever.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0174_pad.wav|They were the presage of storm.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0339_pad.wav|Well, I'll be plumb gosh darned.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0298_pad.wav|His hand shot out and clutched Crooked-Leg by the neck.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0213_pad.wav|Some boy, she laughed acquiescence.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0542_pad.wav|Without a doubt, some of them have dinner engagements.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0058_pad.wav|We must achieve our own salvation.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0531_pad.wav|In what bucolic school of fence he had been taught was beyond imagining.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0177_pad.wav|She had been thoroughly and efficiently mauled.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0209_pad.wav|It was not a large lake, and almost round.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0122_pad.wav|Philip saw MacDougall soon after his short talk with Thorpe.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0014_pad.wav|Now you're coming down to business, Phil, he exclaimed.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0109_pad.wav|Do you know that you are shaking my confidence in you.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0481_pad.wav|Nimrod replied, with a slight manifestation of sensitiveness.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0022_pad.wav|Hardly were our plans made public before we were met by powerful opposition.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0458_pad.wav|The history of the eighteenth century is written, Ernest prompted.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0017_pad.wav|From that moment his friendship for Belize turns to hatred and jealousy.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0059_pad.wav|His immaculate appearance was gone.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0063_pad.wav|Yes, it was a man who asked, a stranger.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0505_pad.wav|How valiantly I went at it that first day.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0566_pad.wav|Dennin's hands were released long enough for him to sign the document.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0457_pad.wav|It was sanctification and salvation.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0507_pad.wav|In short, my joyous individualism was dominated by the orthodox bourgeois ethics.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0470_pad.wav|The very thing, Ernest agreed.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0342_pad.wav|Seventeen, no, eighteen days ago.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0294_pad.wav|He had been foiled in his attempt to escape.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0135_pad.wav|I am going to surprise father, and you will go with Pierre.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0072_pad.wav|But who was Eileen's double.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0174_pad.wav|Hatred and murder and lust for revenge they possessed to overflowing.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0124_pad.wav|It was Jeanne singing softly over beyond the rocks.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0308_pad.wav|His infernal chattering worries me even now as I think of it.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0129_pad.wav|Did Thorpe go to see any one in Churchill.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0103_pad.wav|But there came no promise from the bow of the canoe.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0043_pad.wav|It won't be for sale.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0357_pad.wav|A month passed by, and Bonanza Creek remained quiet.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0003_pad.wav|I can see that knife now.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0555_pad.wav|Jerry was so secure in his nook that he did not roll away.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0257_pad.wav|Tudor surveyed him with withering disgust.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0212_pad.wav|Death is and has been ever since old Maui died.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0193_pad.wav|It was edged with ice.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0178_pad.wav|Every bone in her aged body seemed broken or dislocated.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0111_pad.wav|Instead, he joined her; and they ate like two hungry children.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0276_pad.wav|We were now good friends.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0018_pad.wav|I was completely lost in my work.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0248_pad.wav|Exciting times are the lot of the fish patrol.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0036_pad.wav|He wondered, too, where Roscoe was.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0126_pad.wav|Blood was oozing slowly from the wounded man's right breast.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0145_pad.wav|Besides, had he not whipped the big owl in the forest.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0454_pad.wav|The sharp voice of Wolf Larsen aroused me.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0207_pad.wav|How much was it.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0302_pad.wav|I pulled, suddenly, with all my might.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0119_pad.wav|Jeanne was turning the bow shoreward.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0204_pad.wav|The wolf-dog thrust his gaunt muzzle toward him.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0314_pad.wav|Thus was momentum gained in the Younger World.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0589_pad.wav|I was sick once -- typhoid.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0426_pad.wav|The Gabriel voice of the Samurai rang out.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0269_pad.wav|That's where they cut off the Scottish Chiefs and killed all hands.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0449_pad.wav|Also, she wouldn't walk.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0271_pad.wav|Now please give a plain statement of what occurred.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0465_pad.wav|But such divergence of opinion would constitute no menace to society.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0353_pad.wav|I want to know how all this is possible.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0518_pad.wav|Illuminating oil was becoming all profit.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0102_pad.wav|I'll only be in the way.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0281_pad.wav|I do not blame you for anything; remember that.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0361_pad.wav|There are the canals of China, and the Yang-tse River.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0301_pad.wav|But all my dreams violated this law.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0344_pad.wav|Lots of men take women buggy riding.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0114_pad.wav|He moved his position, and the illusion was gone.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0179_pad.wav|Tomorrow I'm going after that bear, he said.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0084_pad.wav|Scarcely had he uttered the name when Pierre's closing eyes shot open.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0309_pad.wav|Nor was Elam Harnish an exception.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0371_pad.wav|Yield yourself to the waters that are ripping and tearing at you.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0304_pad.wav|His previous wives had never lived long enough to bear him children.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0245_pad.wav|Harrison is still my chauffeur.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0243_pad.wav|They had been on the same lay as ourselves.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0187_pad.wav|Ahead of them they saw a glimmer of sunshine.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0159_pad.wav|His teeth shut with a last click.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0161_pad.wav|In a flash he was on his feet, facing him.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0345_pad.wav|She was trying to pass the apron string around him.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0154_pad.wav|He was smooth-shaven, and his hair and eyes were black.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0216_pad.wav|I wish you were more adaptable, Joan retorted.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0338_pad.wav|It was unobtrusive, yet it was there.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0329_pad.wav|I'd sooner have my chips back.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0114_pad.wav|Her words sent a strange chill through Philip.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0111_pad.wav|The journey was continued at dawn.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0171_pad.wav|And when you come back in a few days, bring Eileen.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0228_pad.wav|You were engaged.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0452_pad.wav|Three oilers and a fourth engineer, was his greeting.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0231_pad.wav|The Resident Commissioner is away in Australia.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0237_pad.wav|So Hughie and I did the managing ourselves.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0593_pad.wav|She'd make a good wife for the cashier.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0437_pad.wav|By that answer my professional medical prestige stood or fell.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0483_pad.wav|Beyond dispute, Corry Hutchinson had married Mabel Holmes.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0430_pad.wav|Nevertheless we found ourselves once more in the high seat of abundance.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0392_pad.wav|There is that magnificent Bob, eating his head off in the stable.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0289_pad.wav|They are not regular oyster pirates, Nicholas continued.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0310_pad.wav|Massage under tension, was the cryptic reply.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0291_pad.wav|The weeks had gone by, and no overt acts had been attempted.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0339_pad.wav|They obeyed him, and went here and there at his commands.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0588_pad.wav|He had proved it today, with his amateurish and sophomoric productions.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0323_pad.wav|He considered the victory already his and stepped forward to the meat.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0521_pad.wav|And he thought of Oona, and of her words.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0292_pad.wav|Here, in the midmorning, the first casualty occurred.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0206_pad.wav|Horses and rifles had been her toys, camp and trail her nursery.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0496_pad.wav|And Tom King patiently endured.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0145_pad.wav|I have to be careful of them, as they tear very easily.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0443_pad.wav|I did not think you would be so early.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0116_pad.wav|Was it the rendezvous of those who were striving to work his ruin.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0259_pad.wav|Her mouth opened, but instead of speaking she drew a long sigh.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0460_pad.wav|The more his opponents grew excited, the more Ernest deliberately excited them.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0201_pad.wav|He cried, and swung the club wildly.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0026_pad.wav|You have associated with some of these men.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0007_pad.wav|And you always want to see it in the superlative degree.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0519_pad.wav|Such an act was in direct violation of the laws of the land.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0296_pad.wav|At times I wondered where Sir Archibald got his style.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0344_pad.wav|He seemed to fill it with his tremendous vitality.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0538_pad.wav|At the best, they were necessary accessories.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0498_pad.wav|I remembered the red wine of the Italian rancho, and shuddered inwardly.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0011_pad.wav|His eyes never took themselves for an instant from his companion's face.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0513_pad.wav|We must give ourselves and not our money alone.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0387_pad.wav|Bob, growing disgusted, turned back suddenly and attempted to pass Mab.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0123_pad.wav|Neither could they understand the growing disaffection among Thorpe's men.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0347_pad.wav|But ever his gaze returned to that Crouched Venus on the piano.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0419_pad.wav|Your father's fifth command, he nodded.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0231_pad.wav|What's that grub-thief got to do with it.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0349_pad.wav|In such a tumbling of values was no time to sell.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0415_pad.wav|It lasted as a deterrent for two days.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0364_pad.wav|In the Bohemian Club of San Francisco there are some crack sailors.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0529_pad.wav|Come on, Del Mar challenged.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0576_pad.wav|And the big Persian knew of his existence before he did of hers.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0279_pad.wav|He gave one last snarl and slid from view among the trees.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0104_pad.wav|Shooting pains passed like flashes of electricity through his body.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0353_pad.wav|Here the explosion of mirth drowned him out.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0251_pad.wav|I may manage to freight a cargo back as well.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0075_pad.wav|In that case he could not miss them, if he used caution.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0107_pad.wav|He was sure, now, of but few things.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0358_pad.wav|The temperature dropped to fifty below zero and remained there the whole trip.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0133_pad.wav|Philip began to feel that he had foolishly overestimated his strength.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0192_pad.wav|He did not rush in.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0541_pad.wav|The Warden with a quart of champagne.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0149_pad.wav|Pebbles and dirt flew along with hair and fur.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0226_pad.wav|That came before my A B C's.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0040_pad.wav|I suppose you wonder why she is coming up here.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0116_pad.wav|I have hunted along this ridge, replied Philip.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0303_pad.wav|Here we allow our solicitors to look after our legal work.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0551_pad.wav|All an appearance can know is mirage.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0236_pad.wav|Don't you see I hate you.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0574_pad.wav|Good business man, Curly, O'Brien was saying.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0321_pad.wav|Instead, he arrived on the night of the second day.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0181_pad.wav|So cheer up, and give us your paw.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0410_pad.wav|Have you ever earned a dollar by your own labour.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0235_pad.wav|Raoul yelled, in order to make himself heard.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0526_pad.wav|Thirty pounds, said the captain with finality.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0166_pad.wav|Fast, but endure.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0407_pad.wav|Mercedes screamed, cried, laughed, and manifested the chaotic abandonment of hysteria.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0485_pad.wav|The mob came on, but it could not advance.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0171_pad.wav|He changed his seat for a steamer reclining chair.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0132_pad.wav|A cry of joy burst from Philip's lips.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0217_pad.wav|Oppressive as the heat had been, it was now even more oppressive.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0559_pad.wav|Peace be unto you and grace before the Lord.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0238_pad.wav|The very thought of the effort to swim over was nauseating.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0173_pad.wav|To these he gave castor oil.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0591_pad.wav|We are both children together.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0110_pad.wav|Much, replied Jeanne, as tersely.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0388_pad.wav|It was my idea to a tee.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0473_pad.wav|Then there was the campaign.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0152_pad.wav|Philip thrust himself against it and entered.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0348_pad.wav|They only lifted seven hundred and fifty.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0449_pad.wav|A sinewy hand, dripping with water, was clutching the rail.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0316_pad.wav|We had been chased by them ourselves, more than once.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0285_pad.wav|The hyena proceeded to dine.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0543_pad.wav|I had been born with no organic, chemical predisposition toward alcohol.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0436_pad.wav|Famine had been my great ally.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0180_pad.wav|If not, let's say our prayers and go to bed.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0374_pad.wav|But life's worth more than cash, she argued.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0359_pad.wav|And as never before, he was ready to obey.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0252_pad.wav|O'Brien had been a clean living young man with ideals.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0289_pad.wav|At first his progress was slow and erratic.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0495_pad.wav|We who have endured so much surely can endure a little more.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0218_pad.wav|The ringing of the big bell aroused him.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0049_pad.wav|Gregson was asleep when he re-entered the cabin.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0119_pad.wav|Billinger may arrive in time.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0476_pad.wav|The reorganization of these countries took the form of revolution.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0047_pad.wav|Close beside him gleamed the white fangs of the wolf-dog.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0149_pad.wav|For an instant he saw Pierre drawn like a silhouette against the sky.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0456_pad.wav|He was an amphibian and a mountaineer.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0527_pad.wav|The very idea of it was preposterous.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0205_pad.wav|From now on we're pals.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0438_pad.wav|At sea, Monday, March 16, 1908.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0133_pad.wav|There followed a roar that shook the earth.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0372_pad.wav|He saw only the effect in a general, sketchy way.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0293_pad.wav|They were deep in the primeval forest.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0572_pad.wav|I never saw anything like her in my life.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0118_pad.wav|We saw your light, and thought you wouldn't mind a call.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0121_pad.wav|They ate dinner at the fifth, and rested for two hours.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0102_pad.wav|He will follow us soon.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0299_pad.wav|I tell you I am disgusted with this adventure tomfoolery and rot.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0411_pad.wav|It will break our hearts and our backs to hoist anchor by hand.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0427_pad.wav|Enters now the psychology of the situation.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0146_pad.wav|After all, it was simply a mistake in judgment.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0106_pad.wav|For a full minute the two men stared into each other's face.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0120_pad.wav|My right foot feels like that of a Chinese debutante.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0039_pad.wav|Philip took a step toward Gregson, half determined to awaken him.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0104_pad.wav|She was sleeping under his protection as sweetly as a child.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0180_pad.wav|I, I beg pardon, he drawled.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0582_pad.wav|Daughtry elaborated on the counting trick by bringing Cocky along.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0346_pad.wav|There's not an iota of truth in it.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0044_pad.wav|Her own betrayal of herself was like tonic to Philip.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0386_pad.wav|I can't argue with you, and you know that.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0462_pad.wav|One guess will do, Ernest retorted.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0525_pad.wav|New idea, he volunteered, brand new idea.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0189_pad.wav|That is what distinguishes all of us from the lower animals.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0455_pad.wav|I obeyed, and a minute or two later they stood before him.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0177_pad.wav|Her gray eyes were flashing, and her lips were quivering.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0493_pad.wav|The boy, O'Brien, was specially maltreated.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0049_pad.wav|There was nothing more, except a large ink blot under the words.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0296_pad.wav|Bassett was a fastidious man.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0418_pad.wav|The Portuguese boy crawled nearer and nearer.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0014_pad.wav|Whitefish, Gregson, whitefish and trout.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0265_pad.wav|I was not to cry out in the face of fear.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0243_pad.wav|I only read the quotations.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0175_pad.wav|Sheldon glanced at the thermometer.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0258_pad.wav|You fired me out of your house, in short.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0430_pad.wav|They were babbling and chattering all together.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0246_pad.wav|The boy grew and prospered.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0081_pad.wav|You were going to leave after you saw me on the rock.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0163_pad.wav|The moon had already begun its westward decline.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0134_pad.wav|Blind with rage, he darted in.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0333_pad.wav|This is no place for you.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0060_pad.wav|He would keep his faith with Gregson for the promised day or two.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0467_pad.wav|Let us run them for ourselves.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0429_pad.wav|And the Eurasian Chinese-Englishman bowed himself away.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0098_pad.wav|Shall I carry you.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0089_pad.wav|The nightglow was treacherous to shoot by.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0422_pad.wav|Halfway around the track one donkey got into an argument with its rider.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0015_pad.wav|They robbed me a few years later.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0284_pad.wav|There was no forecasting this strange girl's processes.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0143_pad.wav|It took him half an hour to reach the edge of it.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0477_pad.wav|Wada, Louis, and the steward are servants of Asiatic breed.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0147_pad.wav|Had it struck squarely it would have killed him.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0070_pad.wav|He would first hunt up Gregson and begin his work there.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0122_pad.wav|Two years ago I gave up civilization for this.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0350_pad.wav|Stand off butcher and baker and all the rest.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0372_pad.wav|Mr McVeigh told me about him.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0170_pad.wav|Then he shouted, Shut up.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0157_pad.wav|In the crib the baby sat up and began to prattle.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0061_pad.wav|Philip snatched at the letter which Gregson held out to him.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0538_pad.wav|What Pascal glimpsed with the vision of a seer, I have lived.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0514_pad.wav|Tomorrow or next day it might he gone.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0294_pad.wav|For a much longer time Lop-Ear and I remained and watched.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0058_pad.wav|I came for information more out of curiosity than anything else.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0403_pad.wav|His newborn cunning gave him poise and control.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0376_pad.wav|Your price, my son, is just about thirty per week.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0136_pad.wav|About him, everywhere, were the evidences of luxury and of age.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0027_pad.wav|To my surprise he began to show actual enthusiasm in my favor.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0457_pad.wav|What I saw I could not at first believe.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0158_pad.wav|Does that look good.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0501_pad.wav|And wherever I ranged, the way lay along alcohol-drenched roads.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0137_pad.wav|But this little defect did not worry him.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0209_pad.wav|He's terribly touchy about his black wards, as he calls them.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0322_pad.wav|Their supply of grub was gone.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0490_pad.wav|Both Johnny and his mother shuffled their feet as they walked.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0252_pad.wav|It resembled tea less than lager beer resembles champagne.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0065_pad.wav|Now have you got anything to say against me, Mr Philip.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0491_pad.wav|And as in denial of guilt, the one-legged boy replied.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0032_pad.wav|Since then some mysterious force has been fighting us at every step.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0062_pad.wav|Now it was missing from the wall.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0082_pad.wav|He bit his tongue, and cursed himself at this fresh break.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0168_pad.wav|Low bush whipped him in the face and left no sting.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0444_pad.wav|Then you don't believe in altruism.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0026_pad.wav|It occurred to me that there would have to be an accounting.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0311_pad.wav|Therefore, hurrah for the game.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0489_pad.wav|He was a merry monarch, especially so for an Asiatic.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0387_pad.wav|It is merely the simple superlative.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0225_pad.wav|The President of the United States was his friend.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0436_pad.wav|But Martin smiled a superior smile.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0277_pad.wav|McCoy found a stifling, poisonous atmosphere in the pent cabin.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0346_pad.wav|Get down and dig in.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0504_pad.wav|He was an athlete and a giant.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0474_pad.wav|I sailed third mate in the little Vampire before you were born.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0389_pad.wav|Mab, she said.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0379_pad.wav|How old are you, daddy.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0502_pad.wav|And as we hurried up town, Joe Goose explained.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0259_pad.wav|Think of investing in such an adventure.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0001_pad.wav|Gad, do I remember it.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0071_pad.wav|What was the object of your little sensation.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0242_pad.wav|The Japanese understood as we could never school ourselves or hope to understand.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0368_pad.wav|I just do appreciate it without being able to express my feelings.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0138_pad.wav|And then, steadily, he began to chew.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0310_pad.wav|A little treatment, massage, with some help from the doctor.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0531_pad.wav|I am sure it must have been some adventure.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0432_pad.wav|He is a candidate, rising from the serf class to our class.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0330_pad.wav|They only had a little thirty thousand dollar fire.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0395_pad.wav|I was beneath the water, suffocating and drowning.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0051_pad.wav|The sixth day he spent in the cabin with Gregson.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0064_pad.wav|I'm going down there with you, and I'm going to fight.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0027_pad.wav|And there's no chivalry, no quarter shown in this fight.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0151_pad.wav|It was steel, a fisher trap.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0400_pad.wav|How could I answer the question on the spur of the moment.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0268_pad.wav|Saxon nodded, and the boy frowned.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0126_pad.wav|Each day she became a more vital part of him.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0515_pad.wav|But here amongst ourselves let us speak out.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0429_pad.wav|Quick was the disappointment in his face, yet smiling was the acquiescence.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0219_pad.wav|Well, there are better men in Hawaii, that's all.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0336_pad.wav|So unexpected was my charge that I knocked him off his feet.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0030_pad.wav|I had faith in them.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0214_pad.wav|Let us talk it over and find a way out.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0562_pad.wav|What the flaming.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0443_pad.wav|He was worth nothing to the world.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0383_pad.wav|A bush chief had died a natural death.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0288_pad.wav|Those are my oysters, he said at last.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0522_pad.wav|For such countries nothing remained but reorganization.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0474_pad.wav|He was manifestly distressed by my coming.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0241_pad.wav|I think it's much nicer to quarrel.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0427_pad.wav|The sunsets grow more bizarre and spectacular off this coast of the Argentine.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0211_pad.wav|This is eighteen eighty.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0004_pad.wav|Lord, but I'm glad to see you again, Phil.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0173_pad.wav|The date was nearly eighteen years old.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0363_pad.wav|It is not an attempt to smash the market.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0131_pad.wav|Providence had delivered him through the maelstrom.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0307_pad.wav|Very early in my life, I separated from my mother.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0199_pad.wav|Thus had the raw wilderness prepared him for this day.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0463_pad.wav|They are his tongue, by which he makes his knowledge articulate.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0262_pad.wav|Saxon's onto her job.
