/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0373_pad.wav|Points of view, new ideas, life.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0215_pad.wav|They die out of spite.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0292_pad.wav|The Fire-Men wore animal skins around their waists and across their shoulders.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0186_pad.wav|I can't go elsewhere, by your own account.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0401_pad.wav|The man smiled grimly, and brought a hatchet and a club.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0558_pad.wav|And the foundation stone of service, in his case, was obedience.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0071_pad.wav|There was no answer from the other side.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0044_pad.wav|For a few moments he ate in silence.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0035_pad.wav|After all, the picture was only a resemblance.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0020_pad.wav|Clubs and balls and cities grew to be only memories.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0424_pad.wav|Obviously, it was a disease that could be contracted by contact.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0215_pad.wav|It is a good property, and worth more than that.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0545_pad.wav|The Italian rancho was a bachelor establishment.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0415_pad.wav|There was nothing for us but the wide raw ocean.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0479_pad.wav|I tried to read George Moore last night, and was dreadfully bored.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0132_pad.wav|There is no need of further detail, now -- for you can understand.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0062_pad.wav|The men stared into each other's face.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0142_pad.wav|Something vastly more thrilling had come into it now.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0308_pad.wav|We never made another migration.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0261_pad.wav|And he did hurt my arm.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0408_pad.wav|The Eldorado emptied its occupants into the street to see the test.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0019_pad.wav|His slim hands gripped the edges of the table.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0393_pad.wav|I was still weak from my prolonged immersion.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0422_pad.wav|This was when the explosion occurred.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0505_pad.wav|We fished sharks on Niihau together.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0500_pad.wav|Who the devil gave it to you to be judge and jury.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0503_pad.wav|The scents of strange vegetation blew off the tropic land.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0139_pad.wav|Together they ate the rabbit.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0377_pad.wav|A scarlet loincloth completed his costume.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0523_pad.wav|The Russian music player, the Count, was her obedient slave.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0434_pad.wav|A half a case of tobacco was worth three pounds.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0261_pad.wav|I have been doubly baptized.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0020_pad.wav|He made no reply as he waited for Whittemore to continue.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0163_pad.wav|Philip made no effort to follow.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0357_pad.wav|The Law of Club and Fang
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0532_pad.wav|That Longfellow chap most likely had written countless books of poetry.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0273_pad.wav|They are big trees and require plenty of room.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0384_pad.wav|The farmer works the soil and produces grain.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0218_pad.wav|The issue was not in doubt.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0277_pad.wav|Two of the Folk were already up.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0388_pad.wav|I made no more overtures.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0453_pad.wav|Eighteen hundred, he calculated.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0577_pad.wav|Once the jews harp began emitting its barbaric rhythms, Michael was helpless.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0030_pad.wav|Gregson held a lighted match until it burnt his fingertips.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0405_pad.wav|And each year something happened, and I did not go.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0050_pad.wav|All this day Gregson remained in the cabin.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0281_pad.wav|Just the same I'd sooner be myself than have book indigestion.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0008_pad.wav|Burke himself had criticized it because of the smile.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0477_pad.wav|You're going in for grab sharing.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0228_pad.wav|But it contributed to the smash.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0463_pad.wav|Take my advice and accept the vacation.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0282_pad.wav|If you mean to insinuate -- Brentwood began hotly.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0144_pad.wav|But there was something even more startling than this resemblance.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0512_pad.wav|You should have seen them when they heard me spitting Chinook.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0454_pad.wav|Eighteen, he added.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0420_pad.wav|On occasion, on this traverse, the Cape Verde Islands are raised.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0083_pad.wav|In it there was something that was almost tragedy.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0312_pad.wav|Dig in; you're sure good, was Daylight's answer.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0147_pad.wav|A moment before he was intoxicated by a joy that was almost madness.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0359_pad.wav|Earth and gravel seemed to fill the pan.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0501_pad.wav|You're joking me, sir, the other managed to articulate.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0182_pad.wav|I was in New York when the crash came.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0229_pad.wav|I saw it all myself, and it was splendid.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0280_pad.wav|Again the girls applauded, and Mrs Hall cried.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0198_pad.wav|Sometimes her dreams were filled with visions.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0253_pad.wav|The very opposite is true; they are discouraged vagabonds.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0233_pad.wav|So she said, the irate skipper dashed on.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0253_pad.wav|He it was that lived to found the family of the Patino.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0278_pad.wav|It would give me nervous prostration.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0549_pad.wav|Do you know that we weigh every pound of coal we burn.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0340_pad.wav|These quick little joys of hers were sources of joy to him.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0189_pad.wav|The big-eyed, clucking moose-birds were most annoying.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0271_pad.wav|It was put together in a casual, helter-skelter sort of way.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0172_pad.wav|Gregson had left the outer door slightly ajar.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0213_pad.wav|Between him and the beach was the cane-grass fence of the compound.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0286_pad.wav|Give them their choice between a fine or an official whipping.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0162_pad.wav|He thought he saw a shudder pass through the Factor's shoulders.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0201_pad.wav|I also understand that similar branch organizations have made their appearance in Europe.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0468_pad.wav|It was introduced by Representative Dick of Ohio.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0293_pad.wav|Between him and all domestic animals there must be no hostilities.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0300_pad.wav|Does the old boy often go off at half-cock that way.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0168_pad.wav|The Indian felt the worship of her warm in his heart.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0319_pad.wav|Daylight was tired, profoundly tired.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0158_pad.wav|She obeyed, shrinking back with the baby in her arms.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0539_pad.wav|You were making them talk shop, Ruth charged him.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0525_pad.wav|The Oligarchy wanted violence, and it set its agents provocateurs to work.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0397_pad.wav|The hunters were still arguing and roaring like some semi-human amphibious breed.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0366_pad.wav|I forgot how easily I had taught myself from the printed page.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0451_pad.wav|I noticed blood spouting from Kerfoot's left hand.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0050_pad.wav|In spite of their absurdity the words affected Philip curiously.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0438_pad.wav|They ran the canoe in and climbed the high earth bank.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0040_pad.wav|The thought set his blood tingling.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0005_pad.wav|Will we ever forget it.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0360_pad.wav|But he no longer cared quite so much for that form of diversion.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0494_pad.wav|Never so strange a prophet came up to Jerusalem.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0533_pad.wav|His abnormal power of vision made abstractions take on concrete form.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0306_pad.wav|Cameron looked at his hands with their long, sinewy fingers.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0159_pad.wav|They look as though he had been drumming a piano all his life.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0455_pad.wav|His reward should have been peace and repose.
