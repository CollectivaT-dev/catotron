/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0492_trimmed.wav|Burnt out like the crater of a volcano.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0405_trimmed.wav|It seemed the ordained order of things that dogs should work.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0018_trimmed.wav|There was a change now.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0366_trimmed.wav|A wildly exciting time was his during the week preceding Thursday the eighteenth.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0534_trimmed.wav|But Johannes could, and did.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0240_trimmed.wav|There are four, all low, McCoy answered.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0096_trimmed.wav|Perhaps she had already met her fate a little deeper in the forest.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0144_trimmed.wav|But there was no longer the mother yearning in his heart.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0502_trimmed.wav|Anything unusual or abnormal was sufficient to send a fellow to Molokai.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0078_trimmed.wav|Then, and at supper, he tried to fathom her.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0396_trimmed.wav|The pain from my hurt knee was agonizing.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0465_trimmed.wav|He'll never do a tap of work the whole Voyage.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0095_trimmed.wav|He heard a sound which brought him quickly into consciousness of day.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0334_trimmed.wav|Oh, it's just a novel, a love story.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0417_trimmed.wav|The next thing to watch out for is bed sores.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0467_trimmed.wav|And so early in the voyage, too.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0117_trimmed.wav|That's Thorpe's, said the young engineer.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0563_trimmed.wav|Mrs McFee's jaws brought together with a snap.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0411_trimmed.wav|He gave no reason, but his motive was obvious enough.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0016_trimmed.wav|There's Fort Churchill, a rifle-shot beyond the ridge, asleep.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0067_trimmed.wav|Surely I will excuse you, she cried.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0181_trimmed.wav|And you preferred a cannibal isle and a cartridge belt.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0472_trimmed.wav|Ernest saw in the affair the most sinister import.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0034_trimmed.wav|Men of Selden's stamp don't stop at women and children.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0376_trimmed.wav|Thought I, and a worthy fool he proved.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0514_trimmed.wav|We are consumed in our own flesh-pots.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0291_trimmed.wav|The awe of man rushed over him again.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0093_trimmed.wav|For a full minute he crouched and listened.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0518_trimmed.wav|But there was also talk of witchcraft in the village.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0282_trimmed.wav|Some of the smaller veins had doubtless been ruptured.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0435_trimmed.wav|What do you mean by this outrageous conduct.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0473_trimmed.wav|The night was calm and snowy.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0012_trimmed.wav|Gregson shoved back his chair and rose to his feet.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0260_trimmed.wav|Nobody knew his history, they of the Junta least of all.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0530_trimmed.wav|Ask him, I laughed, then turned to Pasquini.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0233_trimmed.wav|I never allow what can't be changed to annoy me.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0461_trimmed.wav|By virtue of that power we shall remain in power.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0125_trimmed.wav|It was the third or fourth time that Philip had heard MacDougall swear.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0195_trimmed.wav|Nobody knows how the natives got them.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0164_trimmed.wav|He came first a year ago, and revealed himself to Jeanne.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0512_trimmed.wav|No, it is a palace, wherein there are many servants.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0015_trimmed.wav|It's the aurora borealis.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0342_trimmed.wav|Each improvement makes the value of everything else pump up.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0141_trimmed.wav|It was beating and waiting in the ambush of those black pits.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0547_trimmed.wav|Men like Joe Goose dated existence from drunk to drunk.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0345_trimmed.wav|Daylight made no answer, and the door closed behind him.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0537_trimmed.wav|But she had become an automaton.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0094_trimmed.wav|And yet if she came he had no words to say.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0393_trimmed.wav|Already he had begun borrowing from the banks.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0441_trimmed.wav|And there was Ethel Baird, whom also you must remember.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0435_trimmed.wav|Well, did they eat.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0590_trimmed.wav|In a way he is my protege.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0265_trimmed.wav|The discovery seemed to have been made on the spur of the moment.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0326_trimmed.wav|Cherokee identified himself with his instinct.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0029_trimmed.wav|All operations have been carried on from Montreal and Toronto.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0098_trimmed.wav|Philip looked back from the crest and saw Jeanne leaning over the canoe.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0093_trimmed.wav|Darkness hid him from Jeanne.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0402_trimmed.wav|An altruistic act is an act performed for the welfare of others.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0437_trimmed.wav|Nowhere in the North is the soil so prolific.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0230_trimmed.wav|Now run along, and tell them to hurry.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0136_trimmed.wav|Swiftly his eyes measured the situation.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0290_trimmed.wav|One by one the boys were captured.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0073_trimmed.wav|The promoter's eyes were heavy, with little puffy bags under them.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0479_trimmed.wav|Violation of this law was made a high misdemeanor and punished accordingly.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0153_trimmed.wav|He was a pariah; a wanderer without a friend or a home.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0300_trimmed.wav|From my earliest recollection my sleep was a period of terror.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0406_trimmed.wav|How in hell did he know it was you in the dark.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0208_trimmed.wav|You read the quotations in today's paper.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0031_trimmed.wav|Gregson had seated himself under the lamp and was sharpening a pencil.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0409_trimmed.wav|The dirk mentioned by Wolf Larsen rested in its sheath on my hip.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0321_trimmed.wav|The log on which Lop-Ear was lying got adrift.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0046_trimmed.wav|Philip produced a couple of cigars and took a chair opposite him.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0078_trimmed.wav|There was pride and strength, the ring of triumph in his voice.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0254_trimmed.wav|Straight out they swam, their heads growing smaller and smaller.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0210_trimmed.wav|Whatever he guessed he locked away in the taboo room of Naomi.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0319_trimmed.wav|And the Edinburgh Evening News says, with editorial gloom.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0365_trimmed.wav|These rumors may even originate with us.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0522_trimmed.wav|Nor would it thaw out his hands and feet.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0086_trimmed.wav|He can care for himself.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0264_trimmed.wav|But this time it was Saxon who rebelled.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0414_trimmed.wav|It was impossible to hoist sail and claw off that shore.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0381_trimmed.wav|And how would we ever find ourselves.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0028_trimmed.wav|Lord Fitzhugh is the key to the whole situation.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0208_trimmed.wav|Youth had come back to her, freed from the yoke of oppression.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0386_trimmed.wav|My idea was that he would have more influence over the natives.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0332_trimmed.wav|Unconsciously, our yells and exclamations yielded to this rhythm.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0560_trimmed.wav|His mouth opened; words shaped vainly on his lips.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0404_trimmed.wav|Perrault found one with head buried in the grub box.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0351_trimmed.wav|It was more like sugar.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0360_trimmed.wav|This state of mind comes of an undue prominence of the ego.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0219_trimmed.wav|At first he puzzled over something untoward he was sure had happened.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0302_trimmed.wav|It is very plausible to such people, a most convincing hypothesis.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0480_trimmed.wav|Without discussion, it was the agents provocateurs who caused the Peasant Revolt.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0169_trimmed.wav|Suddenly Jeanne stopped for an instant.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0088_trimmed.wav|He made sure that the magazine was loaded, and resumed his paddling.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0480_trimmed.wav|Tom Spink has a harpoon.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_b0374_trimmed.wav|To say the least, Captain Cook was a rather thorough going empiricist.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0002_trimmed.wav|Not at this particular case, Tom, apologized Whittemore.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0364_trimmed.wav|We have plenty of capital ourselves, and yet we want more.
/content/adaptation_wav/arctic_a0037_trimmed.wav|I was the only one who remained sitting.
